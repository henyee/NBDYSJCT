The Plum in the Golden Vase or The Golden Lotus is a Chinese novel of manners composed in vernacular Chinese during the latter half of the sixteenth centuryduring the late Ming dynasty (1368–1644). It was published under the pseudonym Lanling Xiaoxiao Sheng, "The Scoffing Scholar of Lanling," but the only clue to the actual identity is that the author hailed from Lanling County in present-day Shandong. The novel circulated in manuscript as early as 1596, and may have undergone revision up to its first printed edition in 1610. The most widely read recension, edited and published with commentaries by Zhang Zhupo in 1695, deleted or rewrote passages important in understanding the author's intentions. The explicit depiction of sexuality garnered the novel a notoriety akin to Fanny Hill and Lolita in English literature, but critics such as the translator David Tod Roy see a firm moral structure which exacts retribution for the sexual libertinism of the central characters.]"?</seg>

      <tuv lang="en-US">
        <seg>Canault's gaze jumped between the two other men. He secretly admired Boss Mag for having the powerful presence to go against the archbishop as an ordinary man. At the same time, he was worried that the archbishop would lose his temper.</seg>

        <seg>卢西恩不好酒，却也喝过许多美酒，可就算是在皇宫中喝过的上贡美酒，也从未有这般令他惊艳的感觉。</seg>
      </tuv>
      <tuv lang="en-US">
        <seg>Lucien was not a heavy drinker, but he had tried many good alcohols. However, even those that were presented in the palace did not shock him as much as this wine.</seg>
      </tuv>
    </tu>
    <tu>
      <tuv lang="zh-CN">
        <seg>卢西恩凑近了嗅了一口，依旧一脸不可思议，看着波比道：“这酒……是什么酒？”</seg>
      </tuv>
      <tuv lang="en-US">
        <seg>Lucien inched closer to take a whiff. He was still in disbelief. He looked at Bobby, and asked, "This wine… What is it?"</seg>
      </tuv>
    </tu>
    <tu>
      <tuv lang="zh-CN">
        <seg>卢西恩微微抬手，示意同行的官员不要发怒，看着麦格微笑道：“能够酿出茅台酒这般美酒之人，我相信不会说谎，我先试试这酒的滋味，看看是否合我口味。”</seg>
      </tuv>
      <tuv lang="en-US">
        <seg>Lucien raised his hand slightly, telling the fellow courtiers not to blow their top. He looked at Mag with a smile, and said, "I believe a person who could brew a wine as beautiful as Maotai would not lie. Let me try this drink and see if it suits my tastes."</seg>
      </tuv>
    </tu>
    <tu>
      <tuv lang="zh-CN">
        <seg>卢西恩有些机械性的将手中的酒杯端到嘴边，然后一饮而尽，醉眼更迷蒙了几分，自来熟的挽着麦格的肩膀，有些含糊不清道：“我……我们刚刚说到哪了？”</seg>
      </tuv>
      <tuv lang="en-US">
        <seg>Lucien put the glass to his mouth mechanically, and chugged it down. After that, he appeared even drunker. Lucien put his arms around Mag's shoulder, and slurred, "Wh-where was I?"</seg>
      </tuv>
    </tu>
    <tu>
      <tuv lang="zh-CN">
        <seg>卢西恩的目光先被那三道下酒菜吸引了，一盘花生，这是酒馆常见的下酒菜，不过一般酒馆都会附送一盘花生，而这家酒馆则是将它作为一道下酒菜来贩卖。</seg>
      </tuv>
      <tuv lang="en-US">
        <seg>Lucien's gaze was attracted to the three side dishes at first. They were a plate of peanuts, the most common side dish in taverns. However, taverns would usually give the peanuts out for free, while this tavern sold it as a side dish.</seg>
      </tuv>
    </tu>
    <tu>
      <tuv lang="zh-CN">
        <seg>卢西恩看了一眼他们这次来了八个人，略一思索便道：“来三瓶茅台酒，再来一瓶那个威士忌试试，下酒菜每样来两份，对了，酒鬼花生多上两份。”</seg>
      </tuv>
      <tuv lang="en-US">
        <seg>Lucien took a quick look at their group of eight, and pondered briefly before saying, "We'll have three bottles of Maotai, a bottle of whiskey, and two helpings of the dishes to go with the drinks. Oh, yes, two extra helpings of drunkard peanuts, please."</seg>
      </tuv>
    </tu>
    <tu>
      <tuv lang="zh-CN">
        <seg>卢西恩知道自己已经爱上了这瓶名为威士忌的酒，她是如此的特别，又如此的令人惊喜，只有真正品尝之后才能知晓隐藏在富有欺骗性的香味之下的美妙滋味。</seg>
      </tuv>
      <tuv lang="en-US">
        <seg>Lucien knew that he had already fallen in love with this alcohol called whiskey. It was so special and so surprising. Only those who truly knew how to appreciate it could find the beauty hidden behind its deceptive fragrance.</seg>
      </tuv>
    </tu>
    <tu>
      <tuv lang="zh-CN">
        <seg>卢西恩稍稍打量了一下这家新酒馆，装饰算不上豪华，但也还算舒服，暖黄色的油灯灯光让人觉得舒服，而且酒馆里非常温暖，一进门便让人想要脱掉厚外套。</seg>
      </tuv>
      <tuv lang="en-US">
        <seg>Lucien looked around this new tavern. The renovation was not lavish, but was comfortable enough. The warm yellow light from the oil lamp made one feel very comfortable. On top of that, the tavern was very warm, giving one the urge to take off their thick jacket upon entering.</seg>
